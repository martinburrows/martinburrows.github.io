Welcome! You've found the place where I'll be leaving notes on things I've found interesting or worked on, both for my future reference and maybe to help anyone who stumbles upon a post in the future. 

I work across the full stack from web front-ends to databases and everything in-between. I've spent most of my working life in the Financial and Technology sectors, primarily developing in C# but with plenty of other languanges mixed in too.

Comments and ideas for improvements on any posts here are welcome at any time, and you can also [contact me](/contact) to discuss anything further. Thanks!
